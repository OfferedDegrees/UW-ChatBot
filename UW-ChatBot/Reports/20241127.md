### Last Week's Goals
- Get the RAG model to connect to the frontend

- Implement additional features like an about sidebar and maybe being able to select between different models
- Actually get the RAG model to connect to the frontend because I was not able to do a lot this week
### Progress and issues
- Still working to connect RAG to frontend.
- Still need to preprocess data, need to find a new way to easily webscrabe data
- integration with bedrock needs API call connected, then should be done
- implement sidebar and other nice to have features.
- Was working on a lab for another class the whole week and made like no progress
- Was able to get updated with everyone and what they're doing because last week I told our group to work on a different version of a chatbot, so like another model
