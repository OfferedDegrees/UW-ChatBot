<status update for TA here>

<agenda for team meeting here>

### Last Week's Goals
- Fix the streaming problem
- Connect back and frontend for the beta version
- Clean up more of the design
- Get beta model running
- still working on pre-processing the data
- Get the model to work at all :p
- Have a working model / if the model isn't working a working RAG model
### Progress and issues
- Fixed the streaming and API (you had to hard code the API before, but now you can just create a file just for the API) problem
- Figuring out how to connect the frontend and backend for the RAG model
- Added a different logo
- Rag is working (thanks to ryan) and finishing up powerpoint slides
- still trying to make sure the model can use the data since right now it cannot
- The model ius up and runnign with Bedrock and is able to handle prompts, we want to be able to further build the model
- Rag is working, but still working on some things like follow-up questions and getting the non-rag fine-tuned model to work
### Next Week's Goals
- Get the RAG model to connect to the frontend
- implements new features (small ones)
- finish up pre=processing the data so model can use it
- Fully integrate bedrock with the backend and further prompts.
- Implement additional features like an about sidebar and maybe being able to select between different models
