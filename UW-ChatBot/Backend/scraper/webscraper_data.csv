AI tools show biases in ranking job applicants’ names according to perceived race and gender
University of Washington researchers found significant racial, gender and intersectional bias in how three state-of-the-art large language models ranked resumes. The models favored white-associated names 85% of the time, female-associated names only 11% of the time, and never favored Black male-associated names over white male-associated names.

Population Health
Healthy people, healthy planet
Healthier communities make healthier people.
The University of Washington is at the forefront of addressing the interconnected factors that influence how long and how well we live, from climate change and poverty to systemic inequities and access to medical care. In partnership with community organizations, the UW transforms research into concrete actions that improve and save lives across the country — and around the world.
What is population health?
Population health
is a broad concept encompassing not only the elimination of diseases and injuries, but also the intersecting and overlapping factors that influence health. The UW’s Population Health Initiative is defined by three major pillars:
human health
,
environmental resilience
and
social and economic equity
. Our work addresses the challenges that arise where these pillars intersect.

Spotlight on key issues
Poverty and childhood health
Your early years set the stage for your life. Children who live in poverty have less access to medical care, nutrition and high-quality early education — the foundations for lifelong health. Learn how the UW is working to understand the ripple effects of childhood poverty — and using that research to create better futures for all children.
Learn more
Location and lifespan
How long we live is affected by where we live. Learn what the UW is doing to understand why people in some regions of the United States and the world have a shorter expected lifespan, and how the University is using that research to improve the length and quality of everyone’s lives.
Learn more
Maternal health
For many women around the world — including here in the United States — having a baby isn’t as safe as it should be. Learn what the UW is doing to better understand what causes disparities in pregnancy risks and use that research to improve the health of mothers everywhere.

Tuition & Fees
Tuition Overview
Obligations
When you register for courses at the University of Washington, you are obligated to pay the associated tuition and related fees for those classes unless you officially
drop your classes
by the end of the first week of the quarter. You are billed tuition based on the number of credit hours (including
audit courses
) that you are registered for at the beginning of the quarter.
Rates
Tuition rates
are maintained by Finance, Planning & Budgeting and are based on your grade classification, residency status, tuition graduate tier and the total number of credit hours for which you are registered. This includes classes that you audit. Rates differ depending on which campus you attend, due to slight variations in Services & Activities fees.
If a graduate student falls into two tuition tiers, they will be charged the greater of the two tier rates when producing the tuition bill. To view which tuition tier you belong to, please review the list of
Programs in Each Graduate Tier (by campus)
.

Quarterly/Summer Tuition and Fee Schedules

Undocumented student resources
We are proud to be a university that wholeheartedly welcomes and supports undocumented students of all ethnicities and nationalities. We invite you to explore the services, opportunities and resources available to you throughout the various stages of your Husky Experience.
Undocumented students are immigrants who entered the United States without inspection or overstayed their visas and are present in the United States with or without their parents. They face unique legal uncertainties and limitations within the U.S. educational system.
The majority of undocumented students are characterized as youth that were brought to the United States by their parents at an early age and have lived in this country for a significant portion of their lives, learning the language and adapting to the same American customs taught to other students in schools. Many undocumented students are resilient individuals who have gone through the K-12 system, excel academically in high schools and wish to pursue a college education.

AI tools show biases in ranking job applicants’ names according to perceived race and gender
University of Washington researchers found significant racial, gender and intersectional bias in how three state-of-the-art large language models ranked resumes. The models favored white-associated names 85% of the time, female-associated names only 11% of the time, and never favored Black male-associated names over white male-associated names.

AI tools show biases in ranking job applicants’ names according to perceived race and gender
University of Washington researchers found significant racial, gender and intersectional bias in how three state-of-the-art large language models ranked resumes. The models favored white-associated names 85% of the time, female-associated names only 11% of the time, and never favored Black male-associated names over white male-associated names.

Population Health
Healthy people, healthy planet
Healthier communities make healthier people.
The University of Washington is at the forefront of addressing the interconnected factors that influence how long and how well we live, from climate change and poverty to systemic inequities and access to medical care. In partnership with community organizations, the UW transforms research into concrete actions that improve and save lives across the country — and around the world.
What is population health?
Population health
is a broad concept encompassing not only the elimination of diseases and injuries, but also the intersecting and overlapping factors that influence health. The UW’s Population Health Initiative is defined by three major pillars:
human health
,
environmental resilience
and
social and economic equity
. Our work addresses the challenges that arise where these pillars intersect.

Spotlight on key issues
Poverty and childhood health
Your early years set the stage for your life. Children who live in poverty have less access to medical care, nutrition and high-quality early education — the foundations for lifelong health. Learn how the UW is working to understand the ripple effects of childhood poverty — and using that research to create better futures for all children.
Learn more
Location and lifespan
How long we live is affected by where we live. Learn what the UW is doing to understand why people in some regions of the United States and the world have a shorter expected lifespan, and how the University is using that research to improve the length and quality of everyone’s lives.
Learn more
Maternal health
For many women around the world — including here in the United States — having a baby isn’t as safe as it should be. Learn what the UW is doing to better understand what causes disparities in pregnancy risks and use that research to improve the health of mothers everywhere.

Student housing
A variety of housing options are available at the UW. Offering traditional residence halls, the newest state-of-the-art facilities, apartment-style living and fraternity and sorority housing, there is something for everyone.
Undergraduates
Living on campus is an out-of-class adventure with opportunities to explore who you are and what you value, develop meaningful relationships, and embark on a path of your own choosing. With on-campus housing, your life can be simplified: one-stop, one bill, one priority: you.
Whether you choose to live in a residence hall or an apartment-style building, both options provide students with shared kitchens, study rooms, furniture, and a full list of other benefits and amenities. Choose a Husky Home designed to support your needs!

Tuition & Fees
Tuition Overview
Obligations
When you register for courses at the University of Washington, you are obligated to pay the associated tuition and related fees for those classes unless you officially
drop your classes
by the end of the first week of the quarter. You are billed tuition based on the number of credit hours (including
audit courses
) that you are registered for at the beginning of the quarter.
Rates
Tuition rates
are maintained by Finance, Planning & Budgeting and are based on your grade classification, residency status, tuition graduate tier and the total number of credit hours for which you are registered. This includes classes that you audit. Rates differ depending on which campus you attend, due to slight variations in Services & Activities fees.
If a graduate student falls into two tuition tiers, they will be charged the greater of the two tier rates when producing the tuition bill. To view which tuition tier you belong to, please review the list of
Programs in Each Graduate Tier (by campus)
.

Quarterly/Summer Tuition and Fee Schedules

We are proud to be a university that wholeheartedly welcomes and supports undocumented students of all ethnicities and nationalities. We invite you to explore the services, opportunities and resources available to you throughout the various stages of your Husky Experience.
Undocumented students are immigrants who entered the United States without inspection or overstayed their visas and are present in the United States with or without their parents. They face unique legal uncertainties and limitations within the U.S. educational system.
The majority of undocumented students are characterized as youth that were brought to the United States by their parents at an early age and have lived in this country for a significant portion of their lives, learning the language and adapting to the same American customs taught to other students in schools. Many undocumented students are resilient individuals who have gone through the K-12 system, excel academically in high schools and wish to pursue a college education.

AI tools show biases in ranking job applicants’ names according to perceived race and gender
University of Washington researchers found significant racial, gender and intersectional bias in how three state-of-the-art large language models ranked resumes. The models favored white-associated names 85% of the time, female-associated names only 11% of the time, and never favored Black male-associated names over white male-associated names.

Nobel Prize in Chemistry Goes to UW Professor David Baker
2024 prize awarded for groundbreaking work in protein design
"This is as good as it gets! We are so proud to be the home of some of the most remarkable, creative, innovative and talented faculty, and we don't have a better example of that than David. They are the reason we're recognized as one of the top public universities in the world in terms of positive impact."
Ana Mari Cauce
President, University of Washington
On Oct. 8, David Baker was already an accomplished biochemistry professor in the University of Washington School of Medicine: a computational biologist with more than 640 peer-reviewed research papers, 100 secured patents, and 21 biotech start-ups. But none of that prepared him for the 2 a.m. phone call from Sweden, when Baker learned he’d joined the upper echelon of prestigious international honorees as a recipient of the
2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
. Baker is now the eighth
UW faculty Nobel laureate
.
Baker’s Nobel Prize recognizes his innovative work in computational protein design. The 62-year-old Garfield High School graduate has spent his career at the intersection of medicine and computer science. (His wife, Hannele Ruohola-Baker, is also a UW biochemistry professor, and his parents are retired UW faculty.) Baker is the director of the UW Medicine
Institute for Protein Design
, whose mission is to create new proteins that solve modern challenges across medicine, technology and sustainability.
Baker and his team use computing power and artificial intelligence to design entirely new protein structures
— what he’s referred to as “the workhorses of all living things” — rather than simply amending existing ones. The applications of this science are endless: defense against viruses, targeting and attacking cancer cells, even combating pollution by breaking down harmful plastics in the environment.
“If you look at David’s work, this is about taking these great basic science ideas and pushing them out so that they make a difference in the world,” says UW President Ana Mari Cauce. “That’s what we are all about, and what we want to be for the state and the world.”
Baker’s co-recipients are Demis Hassabis and John Jumper, artificial intelligence researchers at
Google DeepMind
. The Nobel Prizes will be awarded at a ceremony in Stockholm, Sweden, on Dec. 10.
What’s next for protein design? Artificial intelligence’s effect on Baker’s work makes the impact limitless. “I’m very, very excited about the future,” he says. “I think protein design has huge potential to make the world a better place, and I really do think that we’re just at the very beginning.”
Find out more about Baker’s work at the
UW Institute for Protein Design
, which has been supported by donors, foundations and government grants.

Celebrating a Nobel achievement
Messages and celebrations from around the world on social media honored the team’s accomplishments.
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the 2024 #NobelPrize in Chemistry with one half to David Baker “for computational protein design” and the other half jointly to Demis Hassabis and John M. Jumper “for protein structure prediction.”
The Nobel Prize
It's not easy to get hold of a newly awarded Nobel Prize laureate! We are happy that chemistry laureate David Baker took our call, as he turned down "100 calls" while he was on the phone with us.
The Nobel Prize
Warmest congratulations to Nobel Laureate, David Baker! We are so incredibly proud of you and your contributions to the field of protein design. Onward and upward!

Costco Scholarship support made a UW education possible—sparking Carlos Estrada Alamo's multidisciplinary medical career built on boundless curiosity.

T
he emergency room at Harborview Medical Center might seem like an unusual place for a high school student to spend Friday and Saturday nights, but Carlos Estrada Alamo, ’11, was drawn to the community he found there.
Dressed in the salmon-pink scrubs designated for volunteers, he wiped down beds, prepared linens and welcomed patients seeking immediate care. If they were comfortable with it, Estrada would stick around to listen to their stories or observe procedures such as setting a broken bone.
Seeing a range of medical specialists, from pediatricians to neurosurgeons, caring for patients gave Estrada a front-row seat to the “full scope of medicine,” he says. “It was the first time I saw a community that resonated with me—a community focused on the well-being of other people.” That struck a chord in the math-and-science-loving teen, who began thinking about a future in medicine.
But Estrada’s path forward—first to the University of Washington and then to both medical and business school at Harvard University—wasn’t an easy one.
When he was 5 years old, Estrada’s family moved to Seattle from Mexico. Attaining citizenship proved to be an uphill climb, and their undocumented status brought many hardships. Although his parents worked six days a week, Estrada recalls that they couldn’t afford to buy milk—and their grueling work schedules made it difficult to access public health care. The fear of deportation followed Estrada everywhere. At school he felt isolated, and at home he suffered recurring nightmares of hiding in the family’s one-bedroom apartment to escape immigration officers.
But he stayed optimistic that things would get better. “There was always a little voice in my head saying, ‘Your future is in your hands, and education is the way forward,’” he recalls. He carried that mindset into high school, where he excelled in math and science, performed in plays and enjoyed being outdoors.
Getting into the UW, an academic powerhouse close to home, felt like an exciting step into the future he imagined for himself—but there were still financial hurdles to clear. At that time in the mid-2000s, undocumented students like Estrada weren’t eligible for any federal or state financial aid.
What seemed impossible was made a reality by the Costco Diversity Scholarship, awarded to high-achieving Washington students from underrepresented communities. When he was awarded the scholarship, Estrada breathed a sigh of relief, knowing he had guaranteed financial support throughout his undergraduate education.
Stepping onto the UW’s expansive campus in Seattle, Estrada initially felt lost. But he eventually found a supportive group of friends through Greek life—and an inspiring academic path in bioengineering, which applies engineering principles to biology and medicine. Eager to explore the combination of technology and health care, he saw in bioengineering how technology could help remove barriers like those his family had faced.
“It was exciting to apply what you know to help improve people’s lives and access to opportunities,” says Estrada. “Technology is that perfect solution to bridge people into the system in a way that accommodates their needs.”
What seemed impossible was made a reality by the Costco Diversity Scholarship, awarded to high-achieving Washington students from underrepresented communities.
His senior capstone project, developing a diagnostic tool for detecting HIV, gave him the chance to do just that: “I could see the impact I could make in the world.” As a Husky, Estrada continued to gain firsthand medical experience at Harborview, eventually becoming a medical assistant.
But as graduation approached, his undocumented status was still a roadblock to his dream of being a doctor. Most of the medical schools he’d contacted had no experience enrolling undocumented students. To give himself more time to figure out the process, Estrada extended his undergraduate studies to a fifth year and completed a second degree in biochemistry.
By spring 2013, Alamo had permanent resident status and was anxiously waiting to hear back from more than a dozen medical schools. Feeling stressed, he decided to clear his head on an early-morning hike in the mountains, where he had no cellphone reception. Just as he returned to the trailhead, a message popped up in his inbox: he’d been accepted to Harvard Medical School. He would eventually get into every program he applied to.
At Harvard, Estrada was encouraged to follow his intellectual passions. Seeking a bigger-picture perspective on health care, he pursued a concurrent MBA at Harvard Business School. There, Estrada gained not only finance and management skills but also the freedom to apply his experience to solving problems in real-world scenarios. And he saw how these skills could make him a better health care provider.
Earning concurrent MD and MBA degrees fueled his conviction that ideas and technologies from other industries can help transform health care. He put that theory to the test during his medical residency at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia. As an anesthesiology resident, Estrada was ordering blood products for patients without knowing how much was needed for each procedure. Over-ordering led to waste, while under-ordering could put the patient at risk. He wanted a predictive tool to recommend the right amount of blood based on data and patient information—and since one didn’t exist, he resolved to develop it himself.
The project took several years—first talking to clinicians and data analysts, then getting buy-in from senior leadership at the University of Pennsylvania Health System. But it allowed Estrada to do what he felt uniquely qualified for: bridging the gap between doctors and nonmedical experts to solve problems.
It’s an area where Estrada, now working as a general anesthesiologist in Rochester, New York, sees himself in the future. He aims to be a leader in bolstering the health care safety net for the most vulnerable populations, but also to create a new generation of leaders. He plans to continue mentoring current and formerly undocumented students to pursue STEM education.
“My journey demonstrates the immense value of investing in the education and training of future health care leaders,” says Estrada, reflecting on the lasting impact of the scholarship that made it possible for him to attend the UW. “I hope it will inspire others to make a positive difference in the world.”
Celebrating 25 years of the Costco Scholarship
Since 2000, the
Costco Diversity Scholarship
has enabled more than 1,200 Husky undergraduates to attend the UW. Every year, the scholarship is awarded to high-achieving, high-need incoming freshmen from communities traditionally under-served in education. Each student receives $10,000 per year for four years, thanks to the Costco Scholarship Fund, which was created by Costco co-founders Jeff Brotman, ’64 and ’67, and Jim Sinegal.

"It’s a gigantic endeavor to rigorously test the system, but I thought it was important to do that and see how it actually performs," Zaid Harchaoui says of his research on the performance of recent AI products. Photo by Juan Rodriguez.
When ChatGPT launched, the world marveled at what it could do. Artificial intelligence (AI) has been around for decades, but suddenly it felt more accessible. Anyone could use ChatGPT — or similar virtual assistants that followed — to create artwork or write a professional cover letter or develop a training program for their child’s soccer team.
Zaid Harchaoui, professor of
statistics
in the College of Arts & Sciences and adjunct professor in the
Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering
in the College of Engineering, has been more circumspect than most about these recent AI models. Harchaoui focuses on research at the intersection of statistics and computing, with an emphasis on machine learning. Collaborating with colleagues in statistics, mathematics, computer science, and engineering, he explores what AI models do well, where they fall short, and why.
You’ve been studying ChatGPT and similar AI models. What led to that focus?
When ChatGPT came out, the vast majority of people had never interacted with such a thing. When they submitted questions to it, the answers were so mind-blowing that some people started to attribute human-like features to it. But such incidental interactions can be misleading. This is far from a comprehensive and systematic evaluation. Jumping to the conclusion so quickly after a handful of interactions is a superstitious and dangerous thing to do. Even some colleagues were dazzled by the performance of ChatGPT. Many research scientists and engineers lost the usual skepticism that is natural to any scientist in the face of scientific and technological progress. It’s a gigantic endeavor to rigorously test the system, but I thought it was important to do that and see how it actually performs.
"AI models can solve some things quickly, but there are many things that human beings consider easy that those machines will fail miserably at," says Harchaoui. Photo by Juan Rodriguez.
What did you find?
We’re finding that the range of expertise of AI models is different from our range of expertise as humans when it comes to problem solving. AI models can solve some things quickly, but there are many things that human beings consider easy that those machines will fail miserably at. An example is multiplying numbers. Kids, once they understand the rules, can do multiplication well. But AI models seem to struggle with that. Or if several people are crossing the street and one is dressed in gray, a self-driving car with AI might identify that person as a utility pole. That's the kind of mistake that a machine may make that is rare but would be extremely dangerous.
What is causing machines to struggle with some simple tasks?
We don’t know yet. It’s an active research topic, how to make machines more capable to solve a larger set of problems. A decade ago, the gap between mathematical understanding of machine learning and practical applications was not that wide. But as processors for computers have become more powerful and the data we can collect from the internet has exploded, people have been able to create much more complex models that can learn from data without having a mathematical understanding of the models. As a result, many recent advances like
ChatGPT
or
CLIP
were developed by trial and error, with little mathematical understanding of how they are actually tackling the problems.
Trial and error sounds wildly inefficient for AI projects on this scale. How did these projects progress so quickly?
ChatGPT uses a popular AI model called
the transformer model
. In the early 1990s, one component
1
of this model — an attention module that mimics how human attention works, assigning varying levels of importance to input data — was shown to perform well.
2
Around 2017, a group of researchers built a model that just iterates that component, basically like a chain of that same component, and found that when they did that, they got a model that performs really well.
3
Nobody knows why. I'm currently working on better understanding this statistically.
...it's incredible that such large amounts of resources are dedicated to an extremely ambitious pursuit with such a lack of diversity in approaches. It's just a strange dynamic.
Zaid Harchaoui
UW Professor of Statistics & Adjunct Professor of Computer Science
What about other AI models?
In AI right now, everybody is using the same approach — the transformer model — at a very large scale. People are betting that with more computing and more data and larger models, at some point a big intelligence will arise. Maybe it's true. I don't know. But most likely, the lack of alternative approaches will become a big problem. I don't know what will happen, but it's incredible that such large amounts of resources are dedicated to an extremely ambitious pursuit with such a lack of diversity in approaches. It's just a strange dynamic.
After ChatGPT was released, some of its shortcomings emerged. Do you think it was released before it was ready?
"The UW is the perfect environment for this [research] because the University has a culture of collaboration," says Harchaoui. Photo by Juan Rodriguez.
It was a spectacular experiment on a planetary scale. Everyone could test and experiment with it. This reflected a radically new proposal for the transparent development of AI. The whole industry had to quickly align with that peculiar approach. Many of the big industry players had to catch up and release things earlier than they would have preferred. As a result, most of the large models that are currently released are far from being ready as products. They can be very clumsy.
In terms of your own work with AI, what is your end goal?
The current process to produce AI systems is expensive. People say that large corporations by 2025 will be able to design models that have used all the data from the internet, which seems like expensive data usage just to understand simple things that we ask those models to do. The number of
GPUs
[graphical processing units
]
and the
cloud computing
we use for this is just crazy. It's wonderful that we've made all this progress, demonstrating that it was possible with such a debauchery of means — large computing, large data — but now I think we should also try to understand how those models work, what data was really useful and so on, so that we can achieve the same thing with much more economical means. But for me, it's not really about the means. It's more about elegance. In mathematics and statistics, there are proofs that are pedestrian and tedious with many steps and proofs that consist of a few steps and are elegant. So there is some aesthetic challenge that can be shaped by analyzing the current models and understanding why they work.
You’re part of an interdisciplinary team that’s doing this work. How important is it to have an interdisciplinary approach?
AI endeavors involve efforts that are conceptual — coming up with concepts to explain what's going on,  which is more on the mathematical/statistical side — as well as efforts that are more on the engineering side, which is why I collaborate with people in applied AI domains. But it doesn't necessarily mean that collaborative research is compartmentalized that way. There are times when I can be the one contributing more to the applied AI side and they are contributing more to the theoretical foundations side. It’s wonderful when it happens, because you really feel like it is an intellectual endeavor and the boundaries are irrelevant. The UW is the perfect environment for this because the University has a culture of collaboration. When people propose collaborative projects at the UW, everybody's excited.
What are your thoughts on the future of AI?
I think at some point AI will reach a high peak, meaning it will be good at many more things. But it will still not be good at other things. And then, even with more data and more computers, it won’t do much better. Hopefully then people will get back to the workbench and come up with new ideas. I think it's important to maintain a plurality and a diversity of approaches, and to try to understand what's going on so we can come up with those new ideas and simplify what we've been doing so far.

Decoding the universe
UW astronomy undergrads use cutting-edge coding skills to help scientists make the most of discoveries from a revolutionary new telescope.
Left to right: Students Madison R., Max F., Guinevere B., Danbi K., and Professor Mario Jurić in the UW Planetarium.
Danbi Kim is drawn to the vastness of space: its billions of galaxies and trillions of stars, countless planets and moons, and swirling clouds of cosmic dust and gas. Looking at the night sky puts everything on Earth into perspective for Kim, ’26, a University of Washington undergraduate studying astronomy and physics.
“We’re tiny beings living on a tiny rock floating in space,” Kim says. “I think that’s why I started liking space.”
But when Kim first began college, they avoided math and science classes, believing those subjects would be too difficult. A basic astronomy course changed their outlook. The class was hard work, but they loved it — and suddenly saw a whole new path.
“I just felt like I needed to do astronomy for the rest of my life,” says Kim, who was studying the visual arts at a different college at the time. Friends and family were skeptical when Kim shifted gears to study physics, eventually transferring to the UW to pursue an astronomy degree. Kim says, “I now know that I wasn’t bad at STEM — I just needed to find the right place.”
The Vera C. Rubin Observatory, in northern Chile, will begin a comprehensive 10-year survey of the night sky in 2025.
Seen here in the UW Planetarium, these undergrads chose the UW because of its strong astronomy program.
In addition to providing a supportive community and strong academic foundation, the UW is preparing astronomy undergraduates like Kim for careers in and beyond the field by offering the kinds of hands-on opportunities that in many places are reserved for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Kim found one such opportunity in a Python for Astronomy class taught by Professor Mario Jurić, who also leads the UW’s
Institute for Data Intensive Research in Astrophysics and Cosmology
(DiRAC).
The dozen undergrads in the 300-level class used Python, a computer programming language, to tackle questions that Jurić and his DiRAC colleagues are also looking to answer, such as
whether there’s a ninth planet lurking in our solar system
(apologies to Pluto) or
how we can protect ourselves from near-Earth asteroids
. “Usually graduate students get to do the most interesting things,” Jurić says. “But we need to educate the generation that’s going to be here five years from now.” To that end, the students’ class projects led to relevant research findings that will help data astronomers like Jurić when a revolutionary new telescope comes online in 2025 — and changes astronomy as we know it.
Downloading the night sky
Perched on a mountaintop in northern Chile, the
Vera C. Rubin Observatory’s
telescope will produce the most comprehensive survey of the night sky, the 10-year
Legacy Survey of Space and Time
(LSST). The UW was one of the founding members of this ambitious undertaking and will play a key role in making sense of the anticipated discoveries. “Rubin will be our Google of the sky,” explains Jurić. DiRAC, established in 2017, will help analyze the astronomical amount of data expected from the LSST. “We’re building this one machine that’s going to download the entire sky and put it out there for the entire world.”
The Simonyi Survey Telescope features a unique three-mirror design that will give it a broad view of the night sky.
Every night, the Rubin’s
Simonyi Survey Telescope
will capture millions of changes in stars and other objects. This database of the night sky will require algorithms to sift through the billions of bits of information, so DiRAC scientists and engineers are already crafting the software.
And that’s where the future astronomers in Jurić’s class come in.
The twelve undergrads were divided into two groups, each with an exciting mission that would give them a glimpse into the future. By the end of the quarter, could they use their coding skills to predict whether the Rubin’s state-of-the-art telescope would be able to discover a ninth planet in our solar system or prevent an asteroid from colliding into Earth? Those are just two ways in which the Rubin’s discoveries could be truly revolutionary — and why DiRAC scientists are eager for the telescope to finally come alive next year.
Hear from students about how their hands-on research is preparing them for the future.
Launching future careers
By using code to make sense of astronomical data, the students, Jurić says, are learning “how to use the data from this telescope by making predictions and understanding what the telescope is going to do.” This work is valuable, he notes, to both his DiRAC colleagues and the students’ future careers.
If your passion is astronomy, we’ll teach you the skills needed to push the frontiers of science with flagships like Rubin. But […] those same skills will make you competitive in other data-intensive industries as well.”
Mario Jurić
Director, DiRAC Institute
“Learning to code is like learning a foreign language,” explains Kim. “We learn a language to talk to the computer, so we can look at data and try to make conclusions.” For the former graphic arts student, visualizing the data to show the orbits of near-Earth objects was especially rewarding, because it combined math, physics and creativity.
Today’s astronomy is largely a high-tech science, Jurić says, so students need to gain skills in computer science and programming along with the bread-and-butter math and physics curriculum. The UW is the ideal place to lead the charge, he points out, because of its strong astronomy program and deep connections to Seattle’s tech community.
“If your passion is astronomy, we’ll teach you the skills needed to push the frontiers of science with flagships like Rubin,” Jurić says. “But in this AI- and data-driven age, those same skills will make you competitive in other data-intensive industries as well.”
Working together, the students used Python, a computer programming language, to predict what the Rubin Observatory might see.
An example of the code students created to interpret astronomical data.
No matter what path they take after graduation, these students have made a lasting contribution to the exciting work at DiRAC. It’s work that will usher in a new era of astronomy and help us better understand the universe — and our place in it.

C
onsidered one of the world’s leading authorities on battlefield care of musculoskeletal trauma, Captain Dana C. Covey, M.D., ’84, is this year’s recipient of the UW’s Distinguished Alumni Veteran Award. A decorated combat veteran, orthopaedic surgeon and professor, he has dedicated his professional life to contributions to the Navy and the medical profession.
As a professor at University of California San Diego, Covey is a role model for young physicians. His “extraordinary personal standards of competency and dedication to service and integrity, transcend his international reputation as one of the world’s leading authorities on combat surgery,” according to his nomination for the UW award.
Born in Woodland, California, Covey attended the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, where he studied oceanography. He later completed a master’s degree in immunology/zoology from the University of Idaho. In his 40 years in the Navy, he rose to the rank of captain and eventually served as a combat surgeon. His deployments include Iraq and Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, Haiti, the former Yugoslavia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and at sea in the Persian Gulf.
His military decorations include two Legion of Merit awards, a Bronze Star Medal, three Meritorious Service Medals, two Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medals, two Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, a Combat Action Ribbon, a Joint Meritorious Unit Award with Oak Leaf Cluster and numerous campaign, unit and service awards. He is a designated Surface Warfare Medical Officer and achieved Fleet Marine Force Officer Qualification.
In 1984, Covey received his medical degree with honors from the University of Washington. “My education and other experiences during my time at the UW prepared me well for the challenges of orthopaedic surgical training and beyond,” Covey says. “I found my trauma experience at Harborview Medical Center especially beneficial. I had outstanding professors and mentors who inspired me to pursue academic orthopaedic surgery and the education of medical students and residents.”
Covey went on to complete his orthopaedic surgery internship and residency at Louisiana State University and an orthopaedic surgery fellowship in sports medicine and athletic trauma surgery at the University of Pennsylvania. His research includes studying the mitigation of injury in service members through the use of newly improved personal body armor, contributing clinical rationale for the redesigned combat vehicles, enhanced field surgical training, rapid medical evacuation and the close availability of a forward surgical team. His recognition in the medical field rivals his military honors and include Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Award for Excellence in Military Medicine, the American Orthopaedic Association North American Traveling Fellowship, membership in the scientific research honor society Sigma Xi, the Sir Henry Wellcome Medal and Prize for outstanding medical research and the Colonel Brian Allgood Memorial Award for Excellence in Military Orthopaedic Leadership. In 2019, Covey was awarded the William W. Tipton Jr., MD Leadership Award, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons’ most prestigious award in recognition of his outstanding leadership in service to his nation, profession and patients.
A research physician and an innovative scholar whose published work has led to advances in humanitarian care and wartime surgery, Covey is considered a lion in his field. His professionalism epitomizes the ideals expressed in the Navy’s core values of honor, courage and commitment. Despite his long list of accomplishments, Covey regards the UW’s Distinguished Alumni Veteran Award among the highest acknowledgements he has received. “I am honored and humbled to have even been considered for this award from my alma mater, one of the great universities of our nation,” he says.
Currently a professor of orthopaedic surgery at the University of California San Diego, Covey also practices as an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine physician.

Report: UW drives nearly $21 billion, 112,000 jobs to help support Washington’s economy
UW News staff
Across its three campuses, the UW generated a total impact on the state’s economy of $20.9 billion in fiscal year 2023, according to report released today.
University of Washington
Across its three campuses, the University of Washington generated a total impact on the state’s economy of $20.9 billion in fiscal year 2023, according to an economic contribution analysis released today. The study further concludes that the economic activity of the UW system supported or sustained 111,951 jobs statewide.
“These numbers clearly demonstrate the University of Washington’s role as a powerhouse of innovation and economic growth for our state,” said Gov. Jay Inslee. “By driving job creation, research breakthroughs and community development as well as educating tomorrow’s leaders, the UW delivers on its public mission for all Washingtonians. This incredible contribution underscores the vital role public research universities play in building a thriving, dynamic economy.”
The analysis shows that the economic contribution of the UW has increased over the past decade: The analysis shows that the economic contribution of the UW has increased over the past decade rising from $15.7 billion in 2018-2019 to $20.9 billion in 2023-2024. Similar reports in 2015 valued the UW’s impact at $12.5 billion, and $9.1 billion in 2009.
“The University of Washington serves the people and communities throughout Washington in many ways: creating opportunity for students, training vital health care providers and other professionals, and advancing research and innovation in partnership with communities and industry,” said UW President Ana Mari Cauce. “As this report makes clear, the UW is making an impact that betters our state’s economy and improves the health and the lives of everyone we serve. We are proud to contribute and to help make all people in Washington thrive.”
The study measured the economic contribution of UW operations including its campuses and projects in the Puget Sound region, Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue Metropolitan Statistical Area, and across the state of Washington. The study provides individual impact analyses of UW Medicine, the five-state WWAMI Medical Education Program, UW research, Intercollegiate Athletics, UW alumni and CoMotion, a collaborative innovation hub dedicated to expanding the economic and societal impact of the UW community.
For journalists: B-roll and soundbites about this year’s report are available
here
.
The study was conducted by Parker Strategy Group, formerly a part of Parker Philips, a nationally recognized consulting firm specializing in economic impact analysis.
“The UW continues to grow its impact year over year in the city and the state. Continued economic growth is not a foregone conclusion for colleges and universities across the U.S. Once again, the UW shows that it is a sustainable economic driver that is making a significant economic and societal impact on Washington,” said Nichole Parker, managing principal of Parker Strategy Group.
Among the findings in the study:
The
$20.9 billion total economic impact
of the UW in fiscal year 2023. That figure included
$10.3 billion direct and $10.6 billion indirect and induced spending.
The total, was the result of operational, student, visitor and capital spending (three-year average), and payroll and benefits paid to employees.
As a result of UW’s expenditures and student and visitor spending, the University supported or sustained a total of
111,951 jobs — one out of every 34 jobs in the state.
Through its local spending and the jobs it supported or sustained, the
UW generated $962.6 million in state and local taxes
.
UW staff, faculty and students contribute an estimated $
66.4 million annually in charitable giving and volunteerism
.
The UW
supported or sustained $1 out of every $32 in Washington’s economy
.
A large portion of the UW’s overall effect on the state’s economy is attributed to UW Medicine, which has an annual economic impact of $12.5 billion, supports or sustains 60,717 jobs and generates $588.3 million in state and local tax revenue. Beyond the medical and social impact of this integrated health system, UW Medicine connects residents with a top-rated medical school and an internationally recognized research organization. The study shows that UW Medicine’s impact continues to grow.

.
UW’s research enterprise continues to be a driver of impact and discovery. The UW’s $1.87 billion in sponsored research drives $2.6 billion of UW’s overall impact. The UW receives more federal research dollars than any other U.S. public university, according to the National Science Foundation’s
Higher Education Research and Development (HERD)
survey
.
The study also analyzed the individual impact of the UW Bothell and UW Tacoma campuses, both of which make a major impact on the communities they serve and the state of Washington. Both campuses show an increase of jobs and impact in the five years since the previous economic impact study. UW Bothell’s fiscal year 2023 economic impact totaled $394.2 million in the state of Washington, with 2,539 jobs supported or sustained. UW Tacoma in fiscal year 2023 accounted for a $359 million impact in the state of Washington and supported or sustained a total of 2,277 jobs.
In addition to the impact of campus operations, the report also found that the income being added into the economy as a result of graduates obtaining post-secondary education creates impact at the household, community and statewide level. In academic year 2023, the UW conferred over 7,000 bachelor’s, master’s, doctoral and professional degrees. The total number of alumni living and working in the state totals 375,625, a group which will generate $454.6 billion over their careers supporting and sustaining 2 million jobs.

The University of Washington, in cooperation with the USPS, uses a six-digit box number format. All UW box numbers begin with 35____. The last four digits are unique to each office and comprise the last four digits of the ZIP code. UW Box numbers for faculty and staff are listed in the
UW Faculty/Staff/Student Directory
. UW Box numbers for departments are listed in
Departmental Box Numbers
.
A complete UW Seattle campus ZIP code is 98195 + the last four digits of the box number. For example, the zip code for box number 352700 would be: 98195-2700
The best way to guarantee that you have the correct address is to contact the addressee via email or telephone first and request their address.
